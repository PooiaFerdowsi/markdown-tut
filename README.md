My markdown (.md) practices

# Header 1
for substitutes you can use ============ and/or `<h1>`
  
## Header 2
for alternatives you can use ------------ and/or `<h2>`

### Header 3
as an alternative you can use `<h3>`

#### Header 4
`<h4>` is a good alternative!

##### Header 5
and header 5 has five # (sharp) behind header name

###### Header 6
now can you remember what's subtitute? it's `<h6>`

Header 1 like RestructuredText(.rst)

when you want mark text as strong and/or bold you can use double * or _ like
__Hello World used double underscores(_)___
**Hello World used double astriskes(*)***
